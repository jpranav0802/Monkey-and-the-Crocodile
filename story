**Story**
Once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who lived on a berry tree which was located on the banks of a river.
In that exact location there lived a crocodile and its wife. 
One day the crocodile was passing by the river bank, and thought of resting under the tree shade.
On the tree there lived a monkey, who was constantly watching the crocodile sleep.
Later on the kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits. 
The crocodile was obliged seeing the monkey's behaviour and very soon they became very good friends.
The crocodile then used to come everyday near the river to visit the monkey.
One day the crocodile invited the monkey for dinner at his place.
